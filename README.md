## Professional Summary

Seasoned .NET and distributed-systems engineer with **20+ years of experience** delivering C#, .NET Framework, .NET Core, C++17, and Rust solutions across medical imaging, audio rendering, and industrial domains.  
Specialized in architecting ASP.NET Web API and TCP services alongside high-performance WPF (MVVM + async) and Qt/QML applications, embedding microservices patterns and secure data workflows.  
Lead cross-functional teams to modernize legacy platforms onto .NET Core, harden CI/CD pipelines, and deliver measurable performance gains in regulated environments.

## Core Strengths

- **Backend & Distributed Systems**: C++17, C#, Rust, Go; multithreaded TCP socket design; RabbitMQ; RESTful microservices; PostgreSQL/Redis performance tuning.  
- **.NET & UI Engineering**: C#/.NET Framework, .NET Core, ASP.NET Web API, WPF (MVVM, async-await), Qt/QML; IIS-hosted services; reusable SDK/API delivery for clinical devices.  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions; automated CI/CD for containerized workloads; observability, incident response, and infrastructure-as-code adoption.  
- **Leadership & Delivery**: Project planning, roadmap ownership, mentoring; rapid technology adoption and structured knowledge sharing.

## Selected Projects & Impact

### Poza Labs ‚Äî Distributed Audio Rendering Platform (Jan 2023 ‚Äì Feb 2025)
- Directed end-to-end architecture for an audio rendering SaaS, orchestrating C++/Rust control services with Go schedulers, Python data pipelines, and Dockerized workers on AWS.  
- Established an AWS-hosted CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and infrastructure templates, enabling daily release cadence and zero-downtime rollouts.  
- Designed REST integration layers and runtime observability to sustain sub-second orchestration latency while coordinating cross-team incident drills for SLA compliance.

### Ray (Samsung Medical Division, spun off 2015) ‚Äî Medical Imaging Platform Modernization (Feb 2010 ‚Äì Mar 2022)
- Engineered C#/.NET Framework and C++ TCP services plus ASP.NET Web API endpoints hosted on IIS to unify PACS workflows, third-party integrations, and viewer connectivity.  
- Led the migration from a monolith to hybrid .NET Core and C++ microservices with containerized deployments, doubling medical imaging throughput (7‚Üí15 MB/s on a 100 Mbps link) and cutting server-to-viewer latency by 50% (50‚Üí25 ms).
- Introduced WPF MVVM with async-await/TPL patterns and reusable component libraries to streamline radiology UI operations and improve technician productivity.

## Additional Experience

- POSTECH ‚Äî Lead Programmer (Mar 2022 ‚Äì Oct 2022): Built Docker-based TCP data acquisition system using C++/Python to optimize resource usage in distributed research instrumentation.  
- Tilon ‚Äî Senior Researcher (Jul 2009 ‚Äì Dec 2009): Delivered C++03 VNC modules for LG monitor control, visualizing network health in real time.  
- VATECH ‚Äî Software Engineer (Oct 2004 ‚Äì Jul 2009): Developed C++/C# UI and reporting tools for dental imaging, integrating visualization, database back-end, and document workflows.
